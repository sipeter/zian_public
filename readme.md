# Zian - Offline Voice Productivity Tool

> **Your data, always on your device.**  
> A privacy-focused, zero-latency local voice input solution.

## 📖 Introduction
Zian ([ziansoft.com](https://ziansoft.com)) is a voice productivity tool that breaks cloud dependency. Unlike traditional solutions, Zian utilizes your device's local computing power to run deeply optimized AI models directly.

Whether you are writing documents, chatting instantly, or organizing meeting recordings, Zian delivers millisecond-level response speed and absolute data security.

## 🛡️ Privacy First
We understand the value of data. Zian strictly adheres to the following principles:
*   **Fully Offline**: The entire process does not depend on the network; refusing to upload voice data.
*   **Zero Profiling**: No content collection, no behavior tracking.
*   **Transparent & Controllable**: Models, keys, and behavioral logic are fully under your control.

## ✨ Core Features
*   **⚡ Fast Input**: Hold `CapsLock` (default) to speak, release to type. Excellent responsiveness.
*   **💻 Dual Mode**: Supports "Clipboard Paste" & "Simulated Keystrokes", perfectly compatible with various editors and games.
*   **📂 Zian Scribe**: Built-in long audio transcription tool, supporting batch processing and proofreading.
*   **📱 Zian Link**: Turns your phone into a wireless microphone for your PC via LAN, freeing you from hardware constraints.
*   **🧠 AI Smart Polishing**: Automatically removes spoken fillers and optimizes punctuation and paragraphs.

## 💻 System Requirements
Before installation, please ensure your device meets the following conditions:
*   **OS**: Windows 10 / 11 (64-bit)
*   **Environment**: .NET Framework 4.7.2 or higher
*   **Hardware**: Dual-core CPU + 8GB RAM recommended (GPU acceleration supported)

## 🚀 Quick Start
1.  **Unzip**: Extract the archive to a path without special characters (recommended).
